## 🎯 How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Opens App] --> B[Configure Settings]
    B --> C[Tap 'Set Wallpaper']
    C --> D[Generate Initial Wallpaper]
    D --> E[Schedule Daily WorkManager Task]
    E --> F[Midnight Arrives]
    F --> G[WorkManager Triggers WallpaperWorker]
    G --> H[Fetch Settings from DataStore]
    H --> I[Calculate Current Day of Year]
    I --> J[Draw 365 Dots on Canvas]
    J --> K[Apply as Wallpaper via WallpaperManager]
    K --> F
```

### Wallpaper Generation Algorithm
1. Calculate current day of year (1-365/366)
2. Create bitmap sized to screen dimensions
3. Calculate 20-column grid layout
4. For each of 365 positions:
   - Determine color (past/today/future)
   - Apply selected shape (circle, rounded, square, pill)
   - Draw with specified size density
5. Apply subtle glow effect for visual depth
6. Set as system wallpaper
